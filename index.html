    F: Above HFig 150. Plenty of space prior to Fig 200.<br/>
    A: Above DVI&WVI. 59 weeks above the weekly 20 SMA.<br/>
    C: Daily DB confirmed. One (at a push, two) briw recent Hfig Gap Ups, above the daily 20SMA, on increased vol. Most recent (potential entry) candle is BuRPI 95.
    T: IW in play. Trend checker favourable. Bouncer plunging rpi back below 3 after the PB. Green DMA  30SMA  200SMA  30000sma full house. Neat PB on weekly, slightly scrappier on the Daily, but this has allowed the DB to develop, and the all important blue candles to present themselves.
    S: ATH at 185. BRRPI
